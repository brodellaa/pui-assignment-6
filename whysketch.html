                    <h1>SKETCHING APPLICATIONS IN HCI</h1>
                    <p>A common myth about sketching is that it's only applicable to the arts or design fields like industrial design. Sketching is a universal skill that can be applied to HCI, engineering, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some valuable forms of sketching in HCI are storyboards, environments, wireframes, and note annotations.</p>

                    <h1>STORYBOARD</h1>
                    <p>Storyboarding is an effective way to communicate how a product, service, or design works. A typical storyboard includes frames, people, interactions, context, and captions.</p>
                </div>

                    <h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
                    <p>Sketching environments can be useful if you don't want to prototype a concept. For example, this sketch shows a Virtual Reality environment. Instead of using a game engine like Unity, you can sketch out your idea to tell the proper story for engineers to build.</p>

                    <h1>WIREFRAMES</h1>
                    <p>Wireframes are the most common use of sketching in HCI. They quickly allow designers to think through a user experience flow. The better your wireframes are, the more time you can spend in the sketching phase without sacrificing fidelity.</p>

                    <p>These wireframes were sketched on the iPad Pro with the apple pencil using procreate.</p>

                    <h1>TOOLS YOU NEED</h1>
                    <p>Your sketching tools are your portal into design sketching. In order to create great design sketches, you should find a pen you love to use. If you are a novice, we suggest you use a pen as they aren’t erasable. Which means you learn from every stroke, instead of erasing and starting over. Here are a few of our favorite pens </p>

                    <h1>SKETCHING FOR QUALITY COMMUNICATION</h1>
                    <p>Sketching is about communication and believability, not perfection. When you sketch, think about how you can intelligably tell the viewer a message.</p>

                    <p>For example, you can communicate to the viewer the idea of a square by over drawing your lines at the corner. By doing this, you are saying "this sketch is meant to be a square", which the viewer can believe. If you draw a square and connect all four corners, you are saying "this is a perfect square". Perfect squares are physically impossible to draw, therefore, your drawing is not believable.</p>
